# ITSC-2381 – Spring 2025 Class Project Repository

This repository is for our Spring 2025 class project. Please **read this README carefully** before working on the codebase.

# Getting Started
- The project contains placeholders in the HTML and Java components to show where you can insert your work.
- Please work on the area that is designed for your topic. I have included HTML pages based on the topics discussed at the beginning of the semester.
- You're encouraged to customize these sections and create your own components as needed.
- Leave comments explaining what each section does or what you're trying to accomplish. That way, when I implement your changes into my program, I am able to adjust your code if there is an error or warning within it. 

## Example Comments ##
JAVA
// This is my header for the Dashboard tab
// I would like this tab to open the dashboard page

## HTML ##
<!-- I would like for this to open Page B so that it can show the dashboard associated with it -->

## Dashboard Integration ##
If you're adding a dashboard or visual component:
- Indicate where you'd like it to appear (e.g., in a tab, sidebar, or main content area).
- Share your layout preferences: colors, charts, layout examples, etc.
- Screenshots are helpful! You can send them to me directly through my emails provided, or share a document on OneDrive.

## Style & Layout Suggestions ##
IF YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE STLE AND LAYOUT, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION OR ATTACH SCREENSHOTS IN YOUR EMAIL DESCRIBING ANY SUGGESTIONS.
- Page layout/structure
- Color themes or branding
- Fonts or general design 

## Version Control & Communication ##
Important: If you make any changes to the codebase, notify me via email or text so I can keep track of edits and incorporate them into the project flow.

## UI Previews ##
If you want to see how your changes look in the UI:
- Just ask! I can send you screenshots or walk you through how the frontend is displayed and structured.

## Collaboration Best Practices ##
Leave clear comments on any code you write or change.

Use descriptive commit messages:
✅ Good: Added dashboard tab and chart layout
❌ Bad: stuff
- Let me know ASAP if something breaks or you need help debugging.
